# CASTRO-5G

This Open Source repo presents a collection of 5G sparse multipath channel simulation, estimation and location signal processing tools in Python. CASTRO-5G is a repository started as a means to publish the software results of the research project Communications And Spatial Tracking RatiO (CASTRO) funded by Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (MICINN) - Proyectos de Generación de Conocimiento 2021 PID2021-122483OA-I00.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
