# Introduction

### Welcome to the CASTRO-5G repo

We thank you for checking our countribution guidelines.

### Important details

CASTRO-5G is an Open Source project repository started as a means to publish the software results of the research project Communications And Spatial Tracking RatiO (CASTRO) funded by Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (MICINN) - Proyectos de Generación de Conocimiento 2021 PID2021-122483OA-I00. As a consecuence, contributions offered from the project and from third parties might require different treatment or discussion. At this time, during initialization of the project, these circumstances are still unknown and are left for future community discussion with the help of the guidelines below.

### Looking for contributions

The goal of OS project CASTRO-5G is to create a set of Python **libraries** designed *with reusability in mind* that permit the research of signal processing, data communication, channels estimation and user location in state-of-the-art digital wireless communication systems. The project is initialized with 5G in mind but extensions to WiFi7 and their subsequent generations are contemplated. We welcome contributions of two types:

1. Researchers involved in research project CASTRO (PID2021-122483OA-I00), any student under their supervision, and their institutions of affiliation and partners.
2. Any researchers in the wireless research community at large who would like to join the initiative.

### Standalone research usage

The goal of this project is the creation of a **library** with great reusablity that can be installed and run by researchers worldwide. Therefore, while we would greatly appreciate participation of user-level researchers in the community, we would like to encourage the sharing of single-use-case simulation research code in its own repository. We do not believe proposals of contributions in this line are a good fit for this repo, in order to prevent bloat.

# Ground Rules

### Code of Conduct

The project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct version 2.1](https://github.com/gomezcuba/CASTRO-5G/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md), also available at
[https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html][v2.1].

### Goals and Responsibilities

Both participants of types 1 and 2 shall abide by the following guidelines

* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Ensure that code that goes into repository is *versatile* and *reusable*. I.e. that tasks are propertly compartmentalized in function with semmantically meaningful headers and can be employed in a stand-alone fashion.
* Create pull requests and issues for major changes outside, except in your assigned developement branch.
* Don't add redundant or duplicate functionalities to the codebase, as well as single-use-case files that serve a limited purpose for a single research result (with the exception of tutorials)

# Contribution guides

### Getting Started

If you are a TFG, TFM or PhD student interested in contributed to this project, please contact Researcher [Felipe Gomez Cuba](mailto:gomezcuba@gts.uvigo.es) and/or revise the EET's official TFG/TFM assignemnt procedures.

If you are a third party, you may wish to start by checking our publications on mmWave communications, channel estimation and location, as well as discuss with us. Please contact Researcher [Felipe Gomez Cuba](mailto:gomezcuba@gts.uvigo.es) as well.

# How to submit contributions

### Project CASTRO

All TFG students in the project have been asigned a "unique" development branch where they may push their code freely. To submit your code to someone else's dependant dev-branch, please exercise caution and avoid pushing your code without first discussing with the branch responsible. Pull-requests are recommended.

### Significant contributions from third parties

### Submit small quick fixes

### Report a Bug reports

### Suggest a Feature

A process is yet to be established for all of the above. In the interim, please contact [Felipe Gomez Cuba](mailto:gomezcuba@gts.uvigo.es) and we will work it out.

# Code review process

### Project CASTRO

Code developed within the scope of project CASTRO shall be first reviewed by the PI

### Third parties

A process is yet to be designed. Please contact [Felipe Gomez Cuba](mailto:gomezcuba@gts.uvigo.es) and we will work it out.
