# Introduction

### Welcome to the CASTRO-5G repo

We thank you for checking our countribution guidelines.

### Important details

CASTRO-5G is an Open Source project repository started as a means to publish the software results of the research project Communications And Spatial Tracking RatiO (CASTRO) funded by Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (MICINN) - Proyectos de Generación de Conocimiento 2021 PID2021-122483OA-I00. The project is part of the [AtlanTTic](atlanttic.uvigo.es/) research center at University of Vigo. As a consecuence, contributions offered from the project and from third parties might require different treatment or discussion. At this time, during initialization of the repo, these circumstances are still unknown and are left for future community discussion with the help of the guidelines below.

### Looking for contributions

The goal of OS project CASTRO-5G is to create a set of Python **libraries** designed *with reusability in mind* that permit the research of signal processing, data communication, channels estimation and user location in state-of-the-art digital wireless communication systems. The project is initialized with 5G in mind but extensions to WiFi7 and their subsequent generations are contemplated. We welcome contributions of two types:

1. Researchers involved in research project CASTRO (PID2021-122483OA-I00), any student under their supervision, and their institutions of affiliation and partners.
2. Any researchers in the wireless research community at large who would like to join the initiative.

### Please share one-time research results elsewhere

The goal of this project is the creation of a **library** offering general reusablity, that can be installed and imported by researchers in order to facilitate their work. On the other hand, while we would greatly appreciate their participation in the community, we kindly ask researchers that wish to share the specific simulation scripts for the generation a one-time research result to do so in their own repos. We do not believe that contributions  with limited reusability potential are a good fit for this repo, in order to prevent accruing a large number of dependencies as more and more niche simulation scenarios are added.

# Ground Rules

### Code of Conduct

The project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct version 2.1](https://github.com/gomezcuba/CASTRO-5G/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md), also available at
[https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html][v2.1].

### Goals and Responsibilities

Both participants of types 1 and 2 shall abide by the following guidelines

* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. 
* Ensure that code that goes into repository is *maintainable* and *reusable*. I.e. that functions are propertly compartmentalized in modules with semmantically meaningful APIs, that modules can be employed in a stand alone fashion, and that they are structured in ways that facilitate generalization and replacement of components by researchers that wish to evaluate their ideas.
* Create pull requests and issues for major changes, except if you have an assigned individual developement branch.
* Don't add redundant or duplicate functionalities to the codebase, as well as single-use files that serve a limited purpose for a one-time research result (with the exception of tests, examples and tutorials).

# Contribution guides

### Getting Started

If you are a TFG, TFM or PhD student interested in contributed to this project, please contact Researcher [Felipe Gomez Cuba](mailto:gomezcuba@gts.uvigo.es) and/or revise the [EET's official TFG/TFM framework](https://teleco.uvigo.es/es/estudos/organizacion-academica/tfg-tfm/).

If you are a third party, you may wish to start by checking our publications on mmWave communications, channel estimation and location, as well as discuss with us. Please contact Researcher [Felipe Gomez Cuba](mailto:gomezcuba@gts.uvigo.es) as well.

# How to submit contributions

### Project CASTRO

All TFG students in the project have been asigned a "unique" development branch where they may push their code freely. To submit your code to someone else's dependant dev-branch, please exercise caution and avoid pushing your code without first discussing with the branch responsible. Pull-requests are recommended for exchanging code between branches of different owners.

### Significant contributions from third parties

### Submit small quick fixes

### Report a Bug reports

### Suggest a Feature

A process is yet to be established for all of the above. In the interim, please contact [Felipe Gomez Cuba](mailto:gomezcuba@gts.uvigo.es) and we will work it out.

# Code review process

### Project CASTRO

Code developed within the scope of project CASTRO shall be first reviewed by the PI while on its dev branch and integrated into the branch dev-integration for further adjustment. Finally, when signficiant functionalities are stable, they will be merged into the main branch and a new release shall be created.

### Third parties

A process is yet to be designed. Please contact [Felipe Gomez Cuba](mailto:gomezcuba@gts.uvigo.es) and we will work it out.
